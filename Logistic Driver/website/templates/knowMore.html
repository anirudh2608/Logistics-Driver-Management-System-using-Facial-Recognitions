                    This is a logistics driver management system developed by Arjun Bajaj. The project main
                    aim is to provide a secure and safe road journey of a truck driver as many cases 
                    are arrising in India related to truck drivers illegally driving vehicles. The security aspect 
                    of the project is that the face identity of the accepted/hired drivers is in the database 
                    and everytime a driver need to start/stop/pause his journey, he needs to verify his identity.
                    Without it, he/she cannot even see their Dashboard. Hope you like the project.
